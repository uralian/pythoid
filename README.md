# Pythoid

A Python library that provides tools for building dataflows via function composition. It can be mapped to a variety of execution frameworks such as Apache Spark or Hadoop.

### Basic functional nodes

A dataflow can be thought of as a sequence of transformations applied to the source data items: those transformations can be simple 1:1 mappings like $x \rightarrow x^2$, or multi-argument operations like $x,y,z \rightarrow (x+y) \times z$; source values can be generated by the dataflow itself (e.g. loaded from a database) or supplied as arguments when the dataflow is launched. Finally, the output values computed by the dataflow can be returned to the calling process, or materialized elsewhere (e.g. written to an external file), in which case the return value is going to be some sort of handle to the external resource (see *Sink* below).

We can therefore view dataflow as an acyclic graph; for example, this dataflow computes the hypotenuse of a right triangle $c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A --> SQ1{{Compute <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>}}
  B --> SQ2{{Compute <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>}}
  SUM{{Compute <i>x+y</i>}}
  SQ1 -->|x| SUM
  SQ2 -->|y| SUM
  SUM --> SQRT{{"Compute #radic; <i>x</i>"}}
```

The basic building blocks of this library are called nodes; they represent generalized functions that operate on arguments of some type $T$, which can be numbers or strings or booleans or specialized structures like Apache Spark `DataFrame` or `RDD`. Additionally, those functions take the execution context as of their parameters.  Execution context can be anything that makes sense for the chosen computational framework (or can even be `None`) – e.g. a `SparkSession` or `StreamingContext`. Hereinafter it is designated by letter $C$.

The Pythoid type system recognizes the following node types:

- **Source**: An abstraction over a function that takes execution context as the argument and returns an instance of type $T$: $f(C) \rightarrow T$. This is a "producer" node, which generates values – e.g. reading data from a file or external database. It may – but does not have to – utilize the execution context passed to it.
- **Transformer**: An abstraction over a function that takes the execution context and an input value of type $T$ and returns an instance of type $T$: $f(C, T) \rightarrow T$.
- **Join(n)**: An abstraction over a function with multiple arguments: the execution context followed by one or more named input values of type $T$, which returns an instance of type $T$:  $f(C, T^n) \rightarrow T$. Note that in Pythoid a Join node must explicitly declare the number of arguments ("rank" denoted as $n$ above) it expects, along with their names.
- **Sink**: An abstraction over a function that produces some *side effects* (unlike pure functions *Source*, *Transformer*, or *Join* that are assumed side effect free). The return value can be some sort of handle that would allow the user to further access those side effects; it can be nothing, or a file descriptor, or Spark `StreamingQuery` reference etc. Depending on the number of input arguments, Sink is further subclassed into three types:
  - **S-Sink**: A function that takes no arguments of type $T$ and produces nothing but generates side effects: $f(C) \rightarrow \epsilon$
  - **T-Sink**: A function that takes one argument of type $T$ and produces nothing but side effects: $f(C,T) \rightarrow \epsilon$
  - **J-Sink(n)**: A function that takes multiple arguments and produces only side effects: $f(C,T^n) \rightarrow \epsilon$

### Node composition

Nodes are functions so they can be naturally composed. For example, we could build a chain of transformers $tx_1,tx_2, \cdots ,tx_n$ so that the output of one transformer is used as the input for the next one: $T_1 \rightarrow T_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow T_n$. Mathematically this is equivalent to a transformer function $f(C, T) \rightarrow T$ which expands to $tx_n(C, \cdots tx_3(C,tx_2(C,tx_1(C,T))) \cdots )$. In other words, composing a transformer with another transformer yields a transformer. For example, combining transformer defined as $\lambda1 : x \rightarrow x^2$ with transformer $\lambda2 : x \rightarrow \sin x$ produces a transformer equivalent of a function $\lambda : x \rightarrow \sin x^2$.

Now suppose we have a Join(3) node that computes $x,y,z \rightarrow (x + y) \times z$ and a Source node that produces a numerical value. We can compose them by connecting, for example, the output of Source node to the input labeled $y$ of our Join(3) node. This yields a Join(2) node with only two inputs now: $x$ and $z$ (input $y$ is fed from our Source node and not exposed anymore). The figure below illustrates this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Join3 ["Join(3)"]
  X & Y --> SUM{{+}}
  SUM --> MUL{{"#times;"}}
  Z ---> MUL
end

SRC>Src] --> Y
X2[X] ---> X
Z2[Z] ---> Z
```

Finally, let's look at the composition of two Join nodes. This is where things become interesting. Suppose we have a Join(3) node from example above that computes $x,y,z \rightarrow (x + y) \times z$ and a Join(2) that computes $a,b \rightarrow {a \div b}$. We want to connect them in such a way that the output of Join(3) node is connected to input $a$ of Join(2) node. The result is a Join(4) node with inputs $X,Y,Z,B$ that will look as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Join3 ["Join(3)"]
  X & Y --> SUM{{+}}
  SUM --> MUL{{"#times;"}}
  Z ---> MUL
end

subgraph Join2 ["Join(2)"]
  A & B --> DIV{{"#divide;"}}
end

MUL --> A

X2[X] --> X
Y2[Y] --> Y
Z2[Z] --> Z
B2[B] -----> B
```

> Since it is up to the creator of each node to choose labels for their inputs, it is quite possible that combining two nodes will result in a name conflict: for example, if the inputs of Join(2)  above were labeled as $x,y$ instead of $a,b$, this would cause label $y$ appear twice in the input list of the resulting Join(4) node. To avoid this, Pythoid allows *relabeling* the inputs while connecting the nodes – so the example above could look like this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Join3 ["Join(3)"]
  X & Y --> SUM{{+}}
  SUM --> MUL{{"#times;"}}
  Z ---> MUL
end

subgraph Join2 ["Join(2)"]
  A & B --> DIV{{"#divide;"}}
end

MUL --> A

X2[U] --> X
Y2[V] --> Y
Z2[W] --> Z
B2[B] -----> B
```

We can summarize possible compositions in the table below. Each cell shows the resulting node type.
| $\downarrow$ connects to $\rightarrow$ | Transformer | Join(n) | T-Sink | J-Sink(n) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Source**|Source|Join(n-1)|S-Sink|J-Sink(n-1)|
|**Transformer**|Transformer|Join(n)|T-Sink|J-Sink(n)|
|**Join(m)**|Join(m)|Join(m+n-1)|J-Sink(m)|J-Sink(m+n-1)|

...or alternatively in a functional form.
| $\downarrow$ connects to $\rightarrow$ | $f(C,T) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C, T^n) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T) \rightarrow \epsilon$ | $f(C,T^n) \rightarrow \epsilon$ |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| $f(C) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T^{n-1}) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C) \rightarrow \epsilon$ | $f(C,T^{n-1}) \rightarrow \epsilon$ |
| $f(C, T) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C, T) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T^n) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T) \rightarrow \epsilon$ | $f(C,T^n) \rightarrow \epsilon$ |
| $f(C, T^m) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T^m) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T^{m+n-1}) \rightarrow T$ | $f(C,T^m) \rightarrow \epsilon$ | $f(C,T^{m+n-1}) \rightarrow \epsilon$ |

As one can see, a Source composed with a Transformer yields a source, while a Join connected to an input of another Join constitutes a synthetic join with the combined inputs of the two joins; Transformer connected to another node does not change the shape of the resulting node, and so on...

To be continued.
